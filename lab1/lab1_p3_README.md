Lab1 Part3.1

This code calculates the Lennard Jones potential for solid Argon from neighbour list with a specified cutoff distance. The lattice constant is found from https://www.webelements.com/argon/crystal_structure.html , and sigma and epsilon are found from Table 3 row 1 from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378381223001565?via%3Dihub#bib0006 


Lab1 Part 3.2

This code calculates the columb buckingham ionic potential of NaCl. values are obtained from https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3719/10/9/013
