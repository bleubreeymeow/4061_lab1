PHYS4061 projectA part II

Part1: In this C programme, input vector a1, a2 and a3 in terms of x,y,z direction, and the output will be the volume of the unit cell, and the reciprocal vectors b1, b2 and b3.

Part2: In this C programme, input vector a1, a2 and a3 in terms of x,y,z direction, and (x , y , z). periodic boundary condition will then be applied, and the output will be fractional coordinates n1 , n2 and n3, and also x2, y2 and z2.

Part3: run the programme and enter the number of atoms along each direction and enter a numerical value for lattice constant. The programme will print out a nearest neighbour list for each type of lattice structure in a txt file.
